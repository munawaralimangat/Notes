GitHub is an online hosting service for Git repositories. Imagine working on a project at home and while you are away, maybe at a friend's place, you suddenly rememember the solution to a code error that kept you restless for days.

You cannot make these changes because your pc is not with you. But if you have your project hosted on GitHub, you can access and download that project with a command in whatever computer you have access to. Then you can make your changes and push the latest version back to GitHub.
