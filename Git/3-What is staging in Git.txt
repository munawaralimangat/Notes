Staging in Git :

In Git, staging refers to the process of preparing changes to be included in the next commit. The staging area, also known as the index, is an intermediate space where changes to files are gathered before they are committed to the repository. This allows you to carefully select which changes you want to include in a commit, providing more control and organization over your version history.
