How to use Branches in Git :

With branches, you can create a copy of a file you would like to work on without messing up the original copy. You can either merge those changes to the original copy or just let the branch remain independent.

To create a new branch : git checkout -b branch-name ( create and switch to the branch)

checkout tells Git it is supposed to switch to a new branch 

-b tells Git to create a new branch.

git checkout branch-name : This will switch to the branch
