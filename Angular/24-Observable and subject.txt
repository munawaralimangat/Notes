Observable :

Observable is a special type of object that provided by rxjs (Reactive Extentions Js) library , It can produce and emit multiple values, by changing the data. Observable are unicast and also it will not work if there is no consumer( subscribe function )

Observable are unicast because, each subscriber receives its own independent execution of the data stream, each subscriber gets its own copy of the data stream.

Subject :

A subject is a special type of observable provide by rxjs library, that can both emit and receive values. It acts as a data broadcaster, it allows multiple subscribers to receive the same data . Unlike regular Observable which only produces values, a subject can directly emit values and is useful for scenarios where you need to share data among multiple parts of an application.

multicast basically meaning that one Observable execution is shared among multiple subscribers.
