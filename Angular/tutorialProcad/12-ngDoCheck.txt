ngDoCheck :

Angular invokes ngDoCheck hook during every change detection cycle. This hook is invoked even if there is no change in input bound properties.

for example : The ngDoCheck lifecycle hook will run if you clicked a button on webpage, which does not do anything. But still its an event so the chnage detection cycle will run and execute ngDoCheck hook.

angular invokes ngDoCheck lifecycle hook after ngOnChanges and ngOnInit hook

we can use this hook to implement custom change detection , whenever angular fails to detect change made to input bound properies.

The ngDoCheck hook is also a great place to use,when you want to execute some code on every change detection cycle.
