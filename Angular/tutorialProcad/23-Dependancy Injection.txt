Dependancy injection is a design pattern used in software development to manage and inject dependancies into objects or components. Instead o fa component creating its own dependancies, DI provides them from an external source.

Angular uses Dependancy Injection to provide services to components.


@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root'}) tells Angular to provide this service globally, making it available throughout the application.

In the component constructor , we declare a dependency on the service using private  for example  private sevicename: ServiceName 

Angular automatically provides an instance of the service in the component

Dependancy injection is a technique (design pattern) using which a class receives its dependancies from external source rather than creating itself
