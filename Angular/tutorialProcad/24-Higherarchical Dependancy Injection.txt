Higherarchical Dependancy Injecttion :

When we provide a dependancy on a component, the same instance of that dependancy is injected in component class and its child components and their child component s. This is calleld as higherarchical Injection 

Dependancy Override :

When we provide a dependancy on a component and we also provide a dependancy on its child component, child component dependancy instance will override its parent component dependancy instance.

Dependancy Injection on Root Component:

When we provide a dependency on root component , same instance of that dependency is injected to all components , directives and services.

Module Injector 

We can also inject a service from Module class. In that same instance of the dependency will be available throughout the Angular application. In this way we implememt singleton pattern where a single instance is shared throughout the application.
