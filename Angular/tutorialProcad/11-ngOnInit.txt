ngOnInit 

Angular raises ngOnInit hook after it creates the component and update its input properties. This hook is raised after ngOnChanges.

The ngOnInit hook is fired only once that is during the first change detection cycle. After that, if the input property changes, this hook does not gets called.

 By the time ngOnInit gets called, none of the child components or projected contents or view re available at this point.Hence any property decorated with @viewChild , @viewChildren , @contentChild or @contentChildren will not be available to use.
