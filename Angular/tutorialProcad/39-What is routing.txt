What is Routing :

Routing allows us to navigate from one part of our application to another part. In angular, using routing , we can move from view of one component to view of another component.

To implement routing in Angular, we use a built in @angular/router module.

How to define Routes :

Create a new route using Routes array and define some route objects inside that array
-----------------
Register the route using RouterModule.forroot(routeName)
------------------
Use <router-outlet></router-outlet> where you want to render the view of specified route component.
------------------
