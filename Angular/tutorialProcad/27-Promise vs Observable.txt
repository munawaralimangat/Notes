Promise vs Observable :

A promise cannot handle stream of asynchronous data. It always return a single value. On the other hand, we can use observables to handle stream of asynchronous data. It can return multiple values.

A promise will certainly return a data even if no code is using that data. Whereas an observable will return a data only if someome is giving to use that data.

Promise is native to javascript. Whereas observable is not native to javascript and it is provided by 'RxJS' library
