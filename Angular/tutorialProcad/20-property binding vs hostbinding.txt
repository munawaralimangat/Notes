@PropertyBinding vs @HostBinding

@PropertyBinding : is a one-way binding mechanism where data flows from the component's class to the HTML element. It typically used to bind data to HTML element properties.

@HostBinding : is a decorator that allows you to bind a property of the host element (the element that the directive is applied to) to a property in the directive or component class.

Direct event binding in Components : Use template event binding like (event)="method()" to handle events directly in a component.

@HostListener in Directives : Use @HostListener when you need to handle events within a directive , which encapsulate event handling logic and makes it reusable across different elements.
