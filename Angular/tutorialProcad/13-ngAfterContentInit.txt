ngAfterContentInit :

ngAfterviewInit is a lifecycle hook , that is called after the components projected content has been fully initialized

angular will call this hook even after a projected content is not there.

when it is called ?

ngAfterContentInit is called after the default change detector has checked the content and set the properties of the component or directive for the first time

useage: It is commonly used when you need to perform some initialisation logic that depends on the projected content

Angular updates the properties decorated with @contentChild & @ContentChildren decorator just before this hook is raised

This lifecycle hook gets called only once, during the first change detection cycle.After that, if the projected content changes, this lifecycle hook will not get called
