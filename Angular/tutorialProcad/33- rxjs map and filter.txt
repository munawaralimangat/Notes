RxJS map and filter operator :

map operator is used to transform the items emitted by an observable. It applies a given function to each item and emits the resulting values as a new observable.

filter operator is used to filter items emitted by an observable based on a predicate function. Only items that satisfy the predicate function are emitted by the resulting observable
