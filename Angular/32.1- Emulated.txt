Emulated(default)

Angular emulates the behavior of the shadow DOM by adding unique attributes to the component's HTML elements and corresponding styles. This scoping of styles is done during the compilation phase.

Behavior: Styles are scoped to the component but do not use the native Shadow DOM. Other component's style are not affected and global styles do not affect this component.
