Data binding in angular allow us to communicate with component class and it's corresponding view template, and vice versa

we can devide dat abinding in to two 

One way data binding and Two way data binding

One way data binding :
  
  One way data binding is when , data can be  access from component in to its corresponding view template or from the view templat to its component

This can be devided in to two 
 
 1 Component to view
 2 View to component
==================================

Component to view:

One way data binding (data flow from component to view)

string interpolation {{data}}
property binding [property] = data

--------------------------

View to component:
Data flow from view template to component

event binding (data) = 'expression

====================================

Two way data binding :
  
  Two way data binding binds data from component class to view template and view template to componenr class. It is a combination of property binding and event binding

Data flows from component to its view template and from view template to component at the same time
