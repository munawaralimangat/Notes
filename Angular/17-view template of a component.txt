The view template of a component is a form of HTML that tells Angular how to render a component

we can use template property or templateUrl property.

its always a good practive to use templateUrl property,

Disadvantages of template property are:

1 It mixes typescript and html code which makes less maintainable
2 Since html is written as a string , there will be error we will not know during compile time
3 If the number of lines of HTML code is huge , It will be messy & not maintainable
