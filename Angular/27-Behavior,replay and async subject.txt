BehaviorSubject, ReplaySubject and AsyncSubject :

These three are specialized types of subjects each with unique charecteristrics and use cases. 

BehaviorSubject Charecteristics :

Initial Value : Requires an initial value and emits its current value (last emited item) to new subscribers immediately upon subscription.

Stateful : Keeps track of the current value.

Emit All: Emits all subsequent values to all subscribers.

Use cases :

State Management : Commonly used in scenarios where you need to maintain and share a state across multiple components.

Form Controls: Suitable for reactive forms where the form's current value needs to be tracked and shared. 

ReplaySubject:

Charecteristics: 

Replay values: Emits a specified number of last emitted values (buffer size) or all values to new subscribers.

Buffer Size : Configurable to store a certain number of past values.

Use Cases :

Caching : Useful when you need to cache a sequence of events and replay them to new subscribers

Historical Data: When new subscribers need to access previously emitted values.

AsyncSubject :

Charecteristics:

Completion: Only emits the last value of subscribers upon completion.

Single Value:Subscribers receive only the final value once the subject completes.

Use Cases:

Final Value: Suitable for scenarios where you are only interested in the final of an operation.

One-Time Events: Ideal for events that occur only once and need to captured at completion.
