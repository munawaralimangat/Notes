Angular framework is based on four core concepts

Components
Template with Data binding and Directives
Modules
Services and dependency injection

                   --------------------------
Components:

Components are the main building block of an angular application

It is a piece of user interface that 

It is basically a javascript / typescript class along with html template and associated name

It encapsulate a piece of use interface along with its related logic

-------------------------------

Template :

Template is a super set of html, that have the additional functonalites to bind the component data in to the html and dynamically generate HTML DOM elements

The core concept of template can be categorized in to two

1 Data binding(used to bind the data from the component)

2 Directives(used to include logic)

----------------------------------------

Modules :

Angular module is a collection of features /functionalities

It groups multiple components and services in a single context

An angular app can have any number of module, but only one module can be set as root module, which will be bootstrap the application and then call other module as and when necessary

---------------------------------------

Services:

Services are plain js/ typescript class that providing a vety specific functionality

The purpose of service is reusability. Instead of writing in a single component , it will spereate the logic and can be re used with other component.
