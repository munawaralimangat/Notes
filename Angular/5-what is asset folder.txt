The asset folder in angular is the folder where we store static files such as images, fonts, json data that are used by the application.

when we build the angular application, the content of the static files will be stored in to the dist folder maintain the same structure.

Other folders are storing static files that aren't directly shown in your app or need special treatment, it will not copy the files to the dist folder when we build
