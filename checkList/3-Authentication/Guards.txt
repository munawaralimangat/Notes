What is guards 

In angular guards are special classes used to control and manage access to different parts of an application. They decide a user can navigate to a particular route or perform certain action based on specific condition , like checking if the user is logged in or has the necessary permissions.

There are five types of guards :

1 CanActive :
	This guard decides weather a route can be activated. It is commonly used for implementing authentication checks before allowing access to route

2  CanActiveChild :
	Similier to CanActive , but applies to child routes of a route

3 CanDeactive :
	This guard decides if a route can be deactivate ,It prevent users from leaving a route with unsaved changes

4 CanLoad :
	This guard prevents async-loaded modules from loading until certain conditions are met , typically used for lazy-loaded routes

5 Resolve :
	This guard performs route data retrival before route activation , ensuring that data is available before the route is displayed
