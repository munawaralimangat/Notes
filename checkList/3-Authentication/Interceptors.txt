What is interceptors :

An interceptor is a service that can modify http requests and responses. Its useful for tasks like logging , setting headers, handling errors or managing tokens

The angular HTTP interceptors sit between our application and the backend. When the application make a request, the interceptor catches the request(HttpRequest) before it is sent to the backend.

by intercepting request we get access to request headers and body. This enable us to transform the request before sending it to the server
