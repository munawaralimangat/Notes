Managing tokens in angular application involves handling authentication tokens securely to allow users to access protected resourses like api or specific parts of the application.

Understand Authentication tokens

Authentication tokens are like digital keys that prove a user's identity.They typically issued after a user logged in , and are used to authenticate subsequent requests to the server.

There are different types of token used in authentication , but most common are :

1- Access token : Grants access to specific resources or API's for limited period

2- Refresh token : Used to obtain a new access token without requiring the user to log in again. It has longer life span than access tokens 

Implementation :

Angular provides tools like HttpClient for making HTTP requests and interceptors for managing token automatically.

1- User logs in : credentials sent securely to server.
2- Server responds: Provide access and refresh token
3- Token stored: Store securely In local storage(any)
4- Subsequent requests: Attach access token in http headers
5- token expiration : Refresh token used to get new access token 
6- logging out : Token cleared from storage
