Environment files in angular allow us to manage settings and configuration specific to the different environments such as development , testing and production

- They allow us to switch configuration based on the environment without changing the code

- The default environment files are src/environment/environment.ts

and

src/environment/environment.prod.ts 

and also we can create custom environment files 

- import the environment file to the application code , the angular cli handles the replacement based on different environment
