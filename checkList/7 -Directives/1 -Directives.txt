Directives are function that executes when found in the DOM by the angular compiler to extend the power of the HTML with new syntax.

Directives have a name and can be pre defined or custom-defined so they can be called anything.

Directives in General : Directives in angular are markers on a DOM element(such as an attribute , element name, or CSS class) that tells Angular's html compiler (ngCompiler) to attach a specified behavior to that DOM element or even transform it and its children

Three types of directives are :

1 Component Directives :

  In Angular a component is actually a type of directive. More specifically , components are subset of directives with a particular structure and purpose here is the breakdown.

2 Attribute Directive :

 An attribute directive is a type of directive that you apply to elements as attributes in HTML. It allows you to dynamically change the appearance or behavior of those elements bases on conditions or events.  
for example : We can use a an attribute directive to change the background color of an element when the user hover over it , or to toggle visibily based on certain conditions.

3  Structural Directive :

 Structural directives are a type of directive in angular that alters the structure of the DOM by adding , removing or manipulating elements based on conditions. Unlike attribute directives , which change the actual layout by adding or removing elemnts from the DOM tree.
