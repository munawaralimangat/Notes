What is re usable components:

  Re usable components allow developers to create modular and maintainable code.
  
  By creating components that can be re used throughout an application, developers can save time and effort, and ensure that their code is consistent and easy to update

Creating re usable component is an essential part of building scalable and maintainable applications. In angular , building reusable component is a straightforward process that allow developers to minimize duplication and maximise code reuse.
