In angular create functions in services to interact with APIs. These functions use Angular's http module to send requests and receive response from a server.

Managing API request and responses:

HTTP module provides some methods like GET ,POST,DELETE,PUT methods handle communication with server and return Observable objects that can subscribe to in components
