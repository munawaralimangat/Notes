Routing in angular managed by Router module, which provides a mechanism for defining navigation paths and associating them with angular components

- Adding routing means defining different pages or views in your Angulaar app

- Each route has specific URL and shows a different part of your app

How to do this :

- List all your routes in a special file called app-routing.module.ts

-Each route is like a line in a map that tells Angular which component (or page) to show when someone goes to a certain URL

Routes array takes al the routes as object

RouterModule method can call forRoot() function and can pass routes as argument and registering in export array in ngModule decorator
