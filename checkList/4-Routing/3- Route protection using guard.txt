- Route protection is about controlling who can see certain pages in the app

- For example I can protect a profile page that only logged in users can see it 

How to do that :

Create a Guard using anglar CLI 
 
 ng generate guard auth 

define guard logic in that file

Guards are like security check points before someone can enter a page

apply the guard to a route to protect
