Reactive programming is just a different way of building software applications

Essentially , our software is built to react to changes that happen (like click events , data being fetched..etc) instead of the typical way of writing software where we explicitly write code to handle those changes.

Reactive programming is an asynchronous programming paradigm concerned with data streams and the propogation of change.

RxJS reactive Extentions of JavaScript) is a library for reactive programming using observable that make s it easier to compose asynchronous or callback-based code.

RxJS  is a library which helps us in making async calls and implement callback mechanisms.

RxJS consists of three things:
1 Observable 
2 Satelite Data Types - Observers, Schedulers , Subjects
3 Operators - these are array methods
 - map
 -filter
 -reduce
