A 'new' operator does three things while creating  an object using function constructor

1 The 'new' operator first creates an empty object

let person = new Person()

is same as 

let person = {}

2 It also makes sure that the 'this' variable in function constructor point to the newly created empty object

let person = new Person('munawar','28')

it will be like

let person = {
 name: Munawar,
age:28
}

3 Finally , it returns the object from function constructor
