Inheritance is when one object is based on another object i.e. when object get access of properties and methods of another object

In js we can implement inheritance with prototypes

What is prototype

- Each and every javascript object has a prototype property

- Inheritance in javascript is achived using this prototype property

- When we attach a property or a method to prototype property of the object, those methods and properties can be inherited by the instanciated object

Prototypes are the mechanism by the javascript inherit features from one another
