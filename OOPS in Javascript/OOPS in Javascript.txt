+ What is object oriented programming

-Object oriented programming is a programming paradigm(how we write and organize code) based on objects

- In oops we represent real world entities as an object

- An object can have data and behaviour

- The properties are called the data of an object and the methods are called the behaviour of an object

- We use object to pack the data and behaviour of a real world entity all in one block.

+ How object oriented programming works general

- In general OOP woks by defining classes that serve as blue prints for creating objects.

+What are the four pillers of object oriented programming
There are four pillers of Object Oriented Programming

1 Inheritance -

 -Inheritance is a mechanism that allows us to create new classes based on existing class
-With inheritance we can re use the code without repeating a code
-It is the first piller of object oriented programming

2 Encapsulation
 -Encapsulation is a process that hiding data from outside world

- private keyword is make a property hide from the outside world

3 Abstraction
-Abstraction is a way of hiding implementation details and showing only the functionality to user
4 Polymorphism
- Polymorphism means different forms. In oops we can write methods with same name but different implementations
